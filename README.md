### Hi there, I'm Shuyue Wang 👋

- 🎉 [News] I just published my **first** Chrome extension! Check it [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aiofdhjednbbfajbcpmgbblpljncfnkh) for installation. I also make the [initial version](https://github.com/wangsy503/PennCalendar) open source, feel free to raise issues.
- ⌨️ My main programming languages are C++ and Python.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning IOS development and in the progress of developing an IOS app.
- 💡 I have tons of ideas (maybe I should be a product manager?) but my time is limited. If you are interested in collaborating, I'm always open for a chat.
- 📫 How to reach me: Find me at [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shuyuew/) and start a chat with me!
